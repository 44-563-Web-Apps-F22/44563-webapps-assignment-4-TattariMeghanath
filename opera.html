    <h2>TPRINCESS IDA </h2>
    <h3>ACT I -  Pavilion in King Hildebrand's Palace </h3>
    <p> Hildebd:     See you no sign of Gama?

        Florian:                            None, my liege!
      
        Hildebd:     It's very odd indeed.  If Gama fail
                     To put in an appearance at our Court
                     Before the sun has set in yonder west,
                     And fail to bring the Princess Ida here
                     To whom our son Hilarion was betrothed
                     At the extremely early age of one,
                     There's war between King Gama and ourselves!
                          (aside to Cyril)
                     Oh, Cyril, how I dread this interview!
                     It's twenty years since he and I have met.
                     He was a twisted monster — all awry——
                     As though Dame Nature, angry with her work,
                     Had crumpled it in fitful petulance!
      
        Cyril:       But, sir, a twisted and ungainly trunk
                     Often bears goodly fruit.  Perhaps he was
                     A kind, well-spoken gentleman?
      
        Hildebd:                                        Oh, no!
                     For, adder-like, his sting lay in his tongue.
                     (His "sting" is present, though his "stung" is past.)
      
        Florian:     (looking through glass)
                     But stay, my liege; o'er yonder mountain's brow
                     Comes a small body, bearing Gama's arms;
                     And now I look more closely at it, sir,
                     I see attached to it King Gama's legs;
                     From which I gather this corollary
                     That that small body must be Gama's own!
      
        Hildebd:     Ha! Is the Princess with him?
      
        Florian:                                  Well, my liege,
                          Unless her highness is full six feet high,
                     And wears mustachios too — and smokes cigars——
                     And rides en cavalier in coat of steel——
                     I do not think she is.
