    <h4 class="Cyril">Cyril:</h4> <p class="speech">       But, sir, a twisted and ungainly trunk
        Often bears goodly fruit.  Perhaps he was
        A kind, well-spoken gentleman?</p>

<h4 class="Hildebd">Hildebd:</h4><p class = "speech">    Oh, no!For, adder-like, his sting lay in his tongue.</p>
        <p class = "direction">(His "sting" is present, though his "stung" is past.)</p>

<h4 class="Florian">Florian:</h4><p class = "speech">  <p class = "direction"> (looking through glass)</p> 
        <p class = "speech">But stay, my liege; o'er yonder mountain's brow
        Comes a small body, bearing Gama's arms;
        And now I look more closely at it, sir,
        I see attached to it King Gama's legs;
        From which I gather this corollary
        That that small body must be Gama's own!</p>

<h4 class="Hildebd">Hildebd:</h4><p class = "speech">   Ha! Is the Princess with him?</p>

<h4 class="Florian">Florian:</h4><p class = "speech">                                 Well, my liege,
             Unless her highness is full six feet high,
        And wears mustachios too — and smokes cigars——
        And rides en cavalier in coat of steel——
        I do not think she is.</p>
